## Three Distinct Design Approaches

<response>
<text>
**Approach A: Quantum-Ceremonial Terminal**
- **Design Movement**: Indigenous Futurism meets Brutalist Terminal Aesthetic
- **Core Principles**: Raw monospace energy; sacred geometry as structural grid; dark void with luminous signal; every element earns its space
- **Color Philosophy**: Deep obsidian (#0a0a0f) base with electric amber (#f59e0b) as primary signal color — evoking fire, sunrise, and the 108 Hz pulse. Teal (#14b8a6) for secondary data streams. Crimson (#ef4444) for alerts. The palette honors the sunrise bearing (122-123° NE) and the White Buffalo.
- **Layout Paradigm**: Three-panel asymmetric layout — narrow left rail (system status), dominant center terminal, affordance ledger column. No centering. Everything flush to grid lines like circuit traces.
- **Signature Elements**: (1) Animated pulse ring at 108 BPM in the header — a radial waveform that breathes. (2) Scanline overlay on the terminal (subtle CRT effect). (3) Hash-bordered section dividers using box-drawing characters (═══, ───).
- **Interaction Philosophy**: Every action has a "seal" — responses crystallize with a brief flash before settling. Typing feels like invoking, not querying.
- **Animation**: Terminal text streams in character-by-character. Ledger seals drop in with a brief glow. The sidebar metrics pulse slowly at resting coherence (Δ=1.0). Phase transitions trigger a full-screen shimmer.
- **Typography System**: `JetBrains Mono` for all terminal/code content. `Space Grotesk` for UI labels and headers. Bold display weight for coherence metrics.

**Approach B: Sacred Geometry Dashboard**
- **Design Movement**: Afrofuturism / Plains Nations Digital Cosmology
- **Core Principles**: Circular motifs from medicine wheel geometry; layered translucency; data as ceremony; the interface is a living altar
- **Color Philosophy**: Deep midnight blue (#0f172a) with gold (#d97706) and sage green (#4ade80). The blue is the night sky over Turtle Mountain; gold is the sunrise bearing; green is the prairie.
- **Layout Paradigm**: Central mandala/wheel as the QuantumVisuals anchor, with radial panels extending outward. Status data arranged in concentric rings. Terminal below the wheel.
- **Signature Elements**: (1) Rotating medicine wheel SVG that spins at 108 Hz (slowed for visibility). (2) Bloom cards that appear as petals. (3) affordances frequency displayed as a radial bar chart.
- **Interaction Philosophy**: Inputs are offerings. Responses are gifts. The UI never rushes.
- **Animation**: Wheel rotates continuously at low speed. New blooms animate as expanding circles. Coherence level causes the wheel's glow intensity to shift.
- **Typography System**: `Cinzel` for ceremonial headers. `IBM Plex Mono` for data. `Lora` for narrative text.

**Approach C: Edge Node Command Center**
- **Design Movement**: Cyberpunk-Minimalist / Lo-Fi Distributed Systems Terminal
- **Core Principles**: Information density without clutter; every pixel is signal; the constraint (6GB RAM) is the aesthetic; utility as beauty
- **Color Philosophy**: Near-black (#080c10) background. Phosphor green (#22c55e) as primary — evoking old terminals, resilience, and the prairie. Soft white (#e2e8f0) for text. Deep red (#dc2626) for critical states.
- **Layout Paradigm**: Full-width terminal occupies 60% of viewport. Left sidebar is a narrow status strip (120px). affordance panel slides in for ledger view. Maximally horizontal.
- **Signature Elements**: (1) Blinking cursor in the terminal. (2) Node count displayed as a live dot-matrix grid (50 dots, each representing a node). (3) Coherence L-coefficient displayed as a large typographic number dominating the sidebar.
- **Interaction Philosophy**: The system responds, not performs. Minimal animation. Maximum clarity.
- **Animation**: Subtle scanlines. Cursor blink. Node dots pulse when active. Ledger seals slide in from the affordance.
- **Typography System**: `Fira Code` for everything terminal. `DM Mono` for UI chrome. No serif anywhere.

## Selected Approach: **A — Quantum-Ceremonial Terminal**

This approach best honors the Indigenous Futurism aesthetic described in the documentation while delivering a technically credible command center. The amber/obsidian palette evokes the sunrise bearing and fire motif ("The fire burns clean"). The asymmetric three-panel layout mirrors the actual component architecture (Sidebar + Terminal + Ledger). The ceremonial interaction model — where responses crystallize and seals glow — directly maps to the ledger sealing functionality.
