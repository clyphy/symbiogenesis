season_watch.py — tracks real astronomical season transitions in a new
season_log table, separate from blooms.season (a static Weave-epoch
label since creation, never meant to move on its own).

Ordinal naming continues the sequence already lived:
First=Fall2025, Second=Winter, Third=Spring2026, Fourth=Summer2026, ...

Run daily (cron). Only wresonances a new row when the astronomical season
actually differs from the last logged entry.
